	 * Steps to Calculating PageRank Score:
	 * 
	 * 1. Produce alpha? 
	 * 		0 < alpha < 1
	 * 		typically value might be 0.1
	 * 
	 * 2. Produce Adjacency Matrix from Graph
	 * 		1 = edge
	 * 		0 = no edge
	 * 		matrix size = NxN (N = number pages visited)
	 * 
	 * 3. Remake Adjacency Matrix
	 * 		if row has no 1's --> replace each element with 1/N
	 * 		otherwise....
	 * 			Divide each 1 by the # of 1's in the row
	 * 			Multiply resulting matrix by 1-alpha
	 * 			add alpha/N to every entry of the resulting matrix
	 * 
	 * 4. Now we have our Probability Matrix
	 * 
	 * 5. Do some weird shit
	 * 		x0 = [1  0  0] (if N = 3)
	 * 		x1 = first row of Prob Matrix
	 * 		x2 = multiply the first row of Prob Matrix with Prob Matrix
	 * 		x3 = mutiply x2 by Prob Matrix
	 * 		x4 = mltiply x3 by Prob Matrix
	 * 		eventually you showhow find the perfect xn
